<h2>Description
    <p>Spaghetti squash has a very mild, almost neutral flavor.</p>
    <p>The texture is like angel hair pasta â€” it's tender and chewy, but a bit fragile.</p>
</h2>
<h2>Ingredient
    <ul>
        <li>1 (2 pound) spaghetti squash, halved and seeded</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
</h2>
<h2>Steps
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Brush both sides of the squash with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and place cut-side up in a baking pan. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Uncover and continue to roast until tender, about 35 minutes more. Let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Use a fork to scrape the squash flesh into a large bowl and toss with Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
